## Introduction

###### Copy Location

Interactive Brokers’ Client Portal Web API delivers real-time access to Interactive Brokers’ trading functionality, including live market data, market scanners, and intra-day portfolio updates. Clients can communicate directly with IBKR infrastructure, both synchronously using HTTP endpoints and in an asynchronous, event-driven manner via websocket. A variety of [authorization and authentication](#authentication) methods are available to accommodate any use case, including OAuth 1.0a, OAuth 2.0, SSO, and our Java-based CP Gateway tool.

An active Interactive Brokers account is required in order to use the Client Portal API. If you do not already have an account, you can [create one for free](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46380#open-account). Please note that you will have to wait for the account to be fully activated before connecting to the API.

The Client Portal API supports only IBKR Pro accounts.

## Requirements

###### Copy Location

To access the WebAPI, all accounts must follow a few minimum requirements before data can be received.

1.  Must use an opened IB Account (Demo accounts cannot subscribe to data).
2.  Must use an IBKR PRO account type.
3.  Must maintain a funded account.

## WebAPI Basics Tutorial

###### Copy Location

Many of our most common features, as well as instructions for installing and running the Client Portal Gateway, are available in our WebAPI Tutorial Series. The series uses Python to implement the WebAPI functionality; however, the requests and response handling would appear the same across languages.

This tutorial covers:

+   Running the client portal gateway
+   Requesting Live and Historical Market Data
+   Placing and Monitoring Orders
+   Reviewing Individual and Financial Advisor Account Information
+   Handling Market Scanners
+   Implementing a Websocket

## Client Portal Gateway

###### Copy Location

For individual accounts looking to access the WebAPI, developers must authenticate using the Client Portal Gateway, a small java program used to route local web requests with appropriate authentication.

### Limitations of the Client Portal Gateway

###### Copy Location

While the vast majority of the endpoints published by Interactive Brokers’ through our WebAPI documentation can be used in both Client Portal Gateway (CPGW) and through OAuth, there are a few unique limitations of the system that should be understood.

+   Users must log in through the browser on the same machine as Client Portal Gateway in order to authenticate.
+   All API Endpoint calls must be made on the same machine where the Client Portal Gateway was authenticated.
+   None of the endpoints beginning with /gw/api, /oauth, or /oauth2 are supported for use in the Client Portal Gateway.

### How to Download And Run The Gateway

###### Copy Location

### Download and install the Java Runtime Environment

###### Copy Location

As the Client Portal API Gateway was developed using Java, a working installation of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run it. The minimum required version is Java 8 update 192.

In order to check if you have a working installation of Java, open a terminal and run the following command:

`java -version`

If Java is installed and correctly configured you should see information about the currently installed version, otherwise an error is raised.

If you do not have a working installation of Java, you can download it [from the official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

### Download and unzip the Client Portal API Gateway

###### Copy Location

Individual clients using Client Portal API will need to use a Java-based API gateway in order to access protected endpoints. The gateway is responsible for routing requests to the backend and ensuring that the brokerage session is authenticated. Interactive Brokers offers both a Standard and Beta release for our Client Portal API platforms. If you ever experience issues with the standard release, please try our Beta client in case your issue has already been resolved.

### Run the API Gateway

###### Copy Location

In order to launch the Client Portal Gateway, you must execute a set of commands through the Windows Command Prompt or Unix Terminal. This can not be done through the default file explorer. The API gateway is meant to be run on a local machine. As such, attempting to operate the gateway on a separate machine from where commands are generated may result in the issues and is not a supported practice by Interactive Brokers.

By default, the gateway will listen on port 5000. Clients can however change this to any available port on their device by modifying the listenPort field in the gateway configuration file ‘conf.yaml’, found in the ‘root’ directory of the gateway.

After successfully running the gateway, you may proceed through the [Authentication](#authentication) steps before proceeding to calling your requested endpoints.

Using the terminal, Find and open the unzipped Client Portal Gateway directory.

For example, assume my Client Portal Gateway directory is in the Windows *C:/Users/Example/Downloads/* , then I can run the following command to change to the directory:

`cd C:/Users/Example/Downloads/clientportal.gw`

After that, on Windows, launch the gateway using the following command:

`bin\run.bat root\conf.yaml`

And in the case of Unix systems:

`bin/run.sh root/conf.yaml`

### How To Modify The Client Portal Gateway Port

###### Copy Location

In some cases, a user may need to modify the port for their Client Portal Gateway. This most often arises because another process is already occupying Localhost port 5000.

To modify your port:

1.  (Optional) Close the Client Portal Gateway if it is already running
2.  Navigate to your Client Portal Gateway directory, such as /Users/my\_user/cpgw
3.  Enter the ./root directory to edit your conf.yaml file
4.  Modify “listenPort” on line 4 from “5000” to the value of your choice.

+   Port “5001” is a standard alternative that is not typically in use.

6.  Save the content of the file and launch the Client Portal Gateway

```
ip2loc: "US"
proxyRemoteSsl: true
proxyRemoteHost: "https://api.ibkr.com"
listenPort: 5001
listenSsl: true
ccp: false
svcEnvironment: "v1"

```

### Client Portal Gateway FAQ

###### Copy Location

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### Why is my browser saying I have an insecure connection? Why are my requests being rejected because of an invalid SSL certificate?

A:

When navigating to the Client Portal API Gateway login page, you may see a warning from your browser regarding a missing valid SSL certificate. This is expected. The API gateway does not come bundled with a valid certificate and it is up to the user to install one signed by themselves.

**Note:** It is important to note that the connection is only insecure between the user to their own localhost. In other words, only the connection on the local computer is insecure. However, requests sent from the locahost to Interactive Brokers will maintain a secure connection.

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### Can I automate the Client Portal API Gateway authentication process?

A:

There is currently no mechanism available on Interactive Brokers’ end to permit individual clients to automate the brokerage session authentication process when using Client Portal API. Interactive Brokers does not recommend the use of third-party solutions to establish a brokerage session. This can put your account at risk from potentially malicious projects.

**Note:** Interactive Brokers is unable to provide support for third-party wrappers.

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### How often do I need to log in through the browser while using the Client Portal Gateway?

A:

Clients must reauthenticate using the Client Portal Gateway at least once after midnight each day.

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### Why did I received "Server listen failed Address already in use" on my Mac when running the Client Portal Gateway?

A:

This is a known process which operates on MacOS computers which operates on the localhost:5000 port. To resolve this, you will need to Modify The Port Of Client Portal Gateway.

## Authentication

###### Copy Location

After launching the client portal gateway, navigate to localhost:5000 and sign in using your standard Interactive Brokers credentials. After entering your username and password, you will be prompted for Two-Factor Authentication based on your authentication method of choice. After entering your information, you will see  `Client login succeeds` to indicate a successful login.

If you are signing in with your paper account, be sure to use the unique Paper Trading username. This can be found by logging in to the [Client Portal](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php) with your live account’s username then selecting the Head and Shoulders icon in the top right corner and click Settings. Here, you should see a link for Paper Trading account. This will list your Paper Account’s account ID and username.

### Session Authentication

###### Copy Location

An authenticated brokerage session is necessary to access order information, place orders, or receive market data via Client Portal API, and generally across all /iserver endpoints. Individual clients using Client Portal API are required to use the API Gateway in order to establish a secure brokerage session.

Interactive Brokers permits a single username to be signed in once at any given time. However, the Client Portal API permits users to log in without connecting to their brokerage session. This allows brokerage sessions to continue trading while non-brokerage sessions can perform certain actions such as requesting portfolio information without breaking existing trading sessions.

### Background regarding CP Web API sessions:

###### Copy Location

1.  An IB username can only have one brokerage session (trading-enabled) session open at a time, i.e., it can only trade and use similarly restricted functionality on one platform (TWS, Client Portal, etc.) at any given moment, and switching to trading on a different platform entails closing the existing brokerage session and opening a new one from the new platform.
2.  Web API sessions in general are two-tiered:
    +   An “outer” prerequisite “read-only session” that is required to be active/valid in order to make any CP Web API request, though by itself it only permits access to **non-/iserver** endpoints.
    +   The “brokerage session”, established after the read-only, that permits access to trading, consumption of market data, and all other functionality behind **/iserver** endpoints.
3.  This two-tiered arrangement reflects the way our Client Portal website permits you to log into a read-only session for account management when that username is already logged into a brokerage session elsewhere (e.g., TWS), leaving the TWS brokerage session undisturbed.
4.  The CPAPI iframe actually behaves like the CP Gateway mentioned frequently in our CP Web API documentation (the Java-based reverse proxy tool for retail clients). The CPAPI iframe will attempt to establish a brokerage session automatically, as soon as a login occurs and the read-only session is created via SSO.

### Understanding Brokerage Sessions

###### Copy Location

All resources behind /iserver are accessible only with an active “brokerage” session. Some additional info:

1.  TWS being a trading platform requires that a username has trading permissions in order for it to be used to access TWS – there is no purely “read-only” TWS access
2.  The Client Portal website, on the other hand, contains all of the reporting and account management functionality, and consequently it is possible to log in to Client Portal with a read-only/no-trading-permissions username and access reports, portfolio info, etc.
3.  Iserver is effectively TWS running on IB infrastructure, and it serves all of the trading-permissions-required resources, hence the need for a brokerage session to access those endpoints
4.  As a result of #2 and #3, the CP Web API also has this two-tiered session arrangement: The first tier is the read-only Portal session, and the second tier is the brokerage session through which you can talk to /iserver and actually trade the account(s), etc.
5.  After logging in with OAuth without competing sessions, you will have a Portal session and can visit non-iserver resources. The additional [/iserver/auth/ssodh/init](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#ssodh-init) endpoint is used to subsequently reopen a brokerage session with our backend, through which you can access the protected /iserver endpoints.

+   The Client Portal Gateway will automatically initialize the brokerage session.

7.  The brokerage session is associated with the credentials in use – your username – so you don’t need to select an account here. Rather, once you have access to a brokerage session, you can manipulate all accounts visible/accessible to the username in use.
8.  Non-iserver endpoints like /portfolio are served by different backend processes that do not require trading permissions and are accessible without a brokerage session

### Understanding Interactive Brokers terminology

###### Copy Location

A brokerage session (or trading session) is established by a username (your credentials), which in turn has trading permissions for one or more accounts (the actual pools of equity). A single username can only have one trading (or “brokerage”) session active at a time. Permissions for trading in general/ for specific asset classes, market data subscriptions (and thus access to the subscribed feeds), etc. are carried by usernames, not the underlying accounts. Hence references to brokerage sessions refer to a logged-in username that is in contact with IBKR’s backend trading infrastructure.

### Managing Multiple Sessions

###### Copy Location

Only a single active brokerage session can exist for any username accross all IBKR services. If you are logged in to either Client Portal, TWS, or IBKR Mobile, make sure to log out and try reauthenticating your session Client Portal API again.

Clients wishing to use multiple IBKR products at the same time (TWS, IBKR Mobile or Client Portal) can do so by creating a new username that can then be used to log into other services while using the Client Portal API. To create a second username please see the following [IBKR Knowledege Base](https://ibkr.info/node/1004) article.

**Note:** In accordance with market data vendor requirements, market data services are user-specific and any username subscribed will be assessed a separate market data subscription fee.

### Using a Paper Account

###### Copy Location

Customers are encouraged to authenticate and test with their Paper accounts before proceeding to live testing in the Client Portal API. Users may notice that unlike other parts of Interactive Brokers, there is no slider to indicate a live or Paper account login. As such, customers must use their specific Paper username to authenticate. You can find your Paper username by following these steps:

1.  Log in to the [Client Portal](https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login)
2.  Select the Head & Shoulders Icon   ![client portal head and shoulders icon.](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)
3.  Click “Settings”.
4.  On the left under “Account Configuration” select “Paper Trading Account”
5.  You should see a Paper Trading Username, Paper Trading Account Number, as well as options for linking your Market Data.
    +   If you do not know your password already, it is recommended to select “Reset Paper Trading Password” to have a unique password for paper trading. This can be reset at any time.

You may now log in to the Client Portal Gateway using your newfound Paper Trading username and password.

### Authentication Frequently Asked Questions

###### Copy Location

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### How can I tell if my brokerage session is authenticated?

A:

The endpoint **iserver/auth/status** can be used to determine the current authentication status of the session. Once you have logged in using the Client Portal API Gateway, you can make a request to this endpoint to determine if your session is fully authenticated. If the session is fully authenticated, the response from this endpoint will display  `"authenticated": true` .

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### How long does a session remain authenticated?

A:

A session can remain authenticated for up to 24 hours, resetting at midnight for New York, U.S.; Zug, Switzerland; or Hong Kong time depending on your nearest connection.

Sessions will time out after approximately 6 minutes without sending new requests or maintaining the [/tickle endpoint](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#tickle) at least every 5 minutes.

Daily maintenance of IBKR’s servers could result in a disconnect earlier than the 24 hour period mentioned above. We advise disconnecting your session from your gateway and restarting it after the maintenance time to minimize any potential problems that may arise. Information on server reset times and system status updates can be found on the [System Staus](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php) page.

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### How can I prevent the session from timing out?

A:

A Client Portal API brokerage session will timeout if no requests are received within a period of 5 minutes. In order to prevent the session from timing out, the endpoint **/tickle** should be called on a regular basis. It is recommended to call this endpoint approximately every minute.

If the brokerage session has timed out but the session is still connected to the IBKR backend, the response to **/auth/status** returns ‘connected’:true and ‘authenticated’:false. Calling the [/iserver/auth/ssodh/init](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#ssodh-init) endpoint will initialize a new brokerage session.

###### Copy Location

Q:

###### Is it possible to authenticate a live brokerage session without the use of a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) device?

A:

The login process to the Client Portal API Gateway is the same as to Client Portal. As the Client Portal has access to sensitive information and banking functionalities, two-factor authentication is mandatory for login.

## Pacing Limitations

###### Copy Location

Interactive Brokers has implemented pacing limits on endpoints accessible via Client Portal API.

+   There is a global limit of 10 total requests per second.
+   Some endpoint specific limits are also in place. These limits can be found in the table below.
+   Any endpoint not listed in the table below follows the global restriction of 10 requests per second.

Where this limit is exceeded, the API will return a “429 Too Many Requests” exception. Violator IP addresses are put in a penalty box for 15 minutes. After this period, the IP address is removed from the penalty box until another request exceeds the limit again. Repeat violator IP addresses can be permanently blocked until the issue is resolved.

| Endpoint                            | Method | Limit                 |

## Regular Server Maintenance

###### Copy Location

Interactive Brokers maintains regularly scheduled maintenance for all users of the Client Portal API. The system reset time is unique from that of the standard Trader Workstation connection. Clients will see disconnects at midnight of their connecting region.

| Server Reset Times             | North America    | Europe     | Asia      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| **Local Time**                 | 00:00 US/Eastern | 00:00 CEST | 00:00 HKT |
| **Universal Time Coordinated** | 20:00 UTC        | 02:00 UTC  | 08:00 UTC |

## Endpoints

###### Copy Location

To make calls to create or modify data to Interactive Brokers, users must use an URL endpoint through the localhost. Each call is comprised of a base URL and an endpoint.

The base url for the [Client Portal Gateway](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#cpgw) is: **https://localhost:5000/v1/api**

By default, the Client Portal Gateway is not bundled with a signed certificate. As such, customers should either look to independently have their certificate signed, or submit requests to their localhost as ‘insecure’.

OAuth 1.0a users should route requests to **https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api** instead.

Python web requests are displayed with various external libraries that users may wish to implement. While this documentation is built around the *requests* library, there are a few additional libraries to consider:

+   requests
+   json
+   websocket-client

To send ‘insecure’ requests in python, add “verify=False” as a request argument.

Please note that cURL requests are formatted using the cURL standard, [documented here](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html). Some OS specific platforms may be unique, and will require some adjustment.

Our system displays the default bash structure.

+   Unix and bash use \\ (backslash)
+   Powershell will utlize \` (backtick)
+   Command Prompt uses ^ (caret)

To send ‘insecure’ requests in cURL, add “–insecure” into the request.

#### Headers

All requests should include the following Headers:

+   Host: This should be set to “api.ibkr.com”
+   User-Agent: This may be set to anything, though it is best to reference your environment or pull directly from the browser.
+   Accept: This should be set to “\*/\*” to indicate any return format. Typically application/json is returned, though this is not always the case.
+   Connection: This should be set to “keep-alive”.
+   Content-Length: Sending a POST request must include Content-Length. Requests sent without Content-Length will return a 411 error.
    +   Note: Most languages pass this information by default. However, some implementations, such as Java Springboot, may not include these headers in a standard request.

### Event Contracts

###### Copy Location

Interactive Brokers models Event Contract instruments on options (for ForecastEx products) and futures options (for CME Group products).

Event Contracts can generally be thought of as options products in the Web API, and their discovery workflow follows a familiar options-like sequence. This guide will make analogies to conventional index options for both ForecastEx and CME Group products.

IB’s Event Contract instrument records use the following fields inherited from the options model:

+   An **underlier**, which may or may not be artificial:
    +   For **CME products**, a tradable Event Contract will have the relevant CME future as its underlier.
    +   For **ForecastEx products**, IB has generated an artificial underlying index which serves as a container for related Event Contracts in the same product class. These artificial indices do not have any associated reference values and are purely an artifact of the option instrument model used to represent these Event Contracts. However, these artificial underlying indices can be used to search for groups of related Event Contracts, just as with index options.
+   A **Symbol** value which matches the symbol of the underlier, and which reflects the issuer’s product code.
+   A **Trading Class** which also reflects the issuer’s product code for the instrument, and in the case of CME Group products, is used to differentiate Event Contracts from CME futures options.
    +   Note that many CME Group Event Contracts, which resolve against CME Group futures, are assigned a Trading Class prefixed with “EC” and followed by the symbol of the relevant futures product, to avoid naming collisions with other derivatives (i.e., proper futures options listed on the same future).
+   A **Put or Call (Right)** value, where Call = Yes and Put = No.
    +   Note that ForecastEx instruments do not permit Sell orders. Instead, ForecastEx positions are flattened or reduced by buying the opposing contract. CME Group Event Contracts permit both buying and selling.
+   An artificial **Contract Month** value, again used primarily for searching and filtering available instruments. Most Event Contract products do not follow monthly series as is common with index or equity options, so these Contract Month values are typically not a meaningful attribute of the instrument. Rather, they permit filtering of instruments by calendar month.
+   A **Last Trade Date, Time, and Millisecond** values, which together indicate precisely when trading in an Event Contract will cease, just as with index options.
+   An **Expected Resolution Time** when the outcome of the tracked event is published, and contracts are determined to be in or out of the money. This is commonly referred to as the contract’s “expiration date”.
+   An **Expected Payout Time** when contracts are settled and removed from accounts. Proceeds are paid out to those expiring in the money.
+   A **Measured Period** as defined in the contract’s question. This is the primary date used for organization of contracts (as in an options chain).
+   A **Strike** value, which is the numerical value on which the event resolution hinges. Though numerical, this value need not represent a price.
+   An **instrument description (or “local symbol”)** in the form `"PRODUCT EXPIRATION STRIKE RIGHT"`, where:
    +   `PRODUCT` is the issuer’s product identifier
    +   `EXPIRATION` is the date of the instrument’s resolution in the form `MmmDD'YY`, e.g., “Sep26’24”
    +   `STRIKE` is the numerical value that determines the contract’s moneyness at expiration
    +   `RIGHT` is a value YES or NO

### Categorization

###### Copy Location

ForecastEx forecast contracts are sorted into a category hierarchy for organizational purposes.

These categories are metadata rather than immutable attributes of the tradable instruments themselves – they can be expected to change slightly over time.

This category tree is three levels deep, and its leaves (the level 3 categories) contain the forecast contracts “Markets” — groups of tradable contracts sharing questions of the same form e.g. “will the Fed Funds rate on X date exceed Y percent”.

The `/trsrv/event/category-tree` endpoint can be used to retrieve the complete category tree.

We make a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

`https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/trsrv/event/category-tree`

No parameters are provided.

In response, we receive an object containing all categories, organized by their category ID in the form `g1234`.

```
{
  "g1003": {
    "label": "Economic Indicators",
    "markets": []
  },
  ...,
  "g17574": {
    "label": "Industry",

        "conid": 751047561
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
}
```

### Markets and Strikes

###### Copy Location

ForecastEx forecast contracts are modeled as options or futures options, depending on the event they resolve against.

Because they are derivative products, they are always listed against an underlier. Presently forecast contract underliers are either an index or futures contract. The underliers will have their own contract IDs separate from the contract IDs of the forecast contracts.

These underlier contract IDs can be used to retrieve relevant historical data sets for the underlying event, where available. For example, the GT (Global Temperature) contracts are listed against a GT index, and the index data set is historical global temperature data sourced from NOAA.

In all cases, a Market has a symbol, mirroring options. Examples: FF, HORC, USIP

Forecast contracts, like options, have a strike and expiration. Strike value need not be numeric; for instance, for election-related contracts it will be a candidate’s name. The strikeLabel field in the `/contracts` response delivers these strings.

All contracts have a true expiration which is the resolution time mentioned above after which the contract is considered resolved and it ceases to exist.

A fully specified question, including the strike value and measured period, is referred to as a “strike” – similar to a specific strike row in a two-sided option chain table.

Each such strike has two contracts associated with it: YES and NO.

IBKR assigns a separate contract ID to both the YES and NO contracts of a given strike.

Following from the options model: YES is a Call, and NO is a Put.

For each contract:

+   The long (and canonical) form of this question is delivered in the longDescription field.
+   A shortened options-style form is delivered in the shortDescription field.

Note that YES and NO contracts each have their own bid/ask/last data.

The `/trsrv/event/contracts` endpoint can be used to retrieve complete contract records for all tradable forecast contracts in a given Market (listed on the same underlier).

We make a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

`https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/trsrv/event/contracts?market=733131966&exchange=FORECASTX`

And we provide the following parameters:

+   The contract ID of the Market: `market=733131966`
+   Exchange on which the event contracts trade: `exchange=FORECASTX`

}

### Order Submission

###### Copy Location

Submission of orders for Event Contracts via the Web API functions like orders for any other instrument.

However, it is important to note the differing mechanics between CME Group products and ForecastEx instruments:

+   CME Group instruments can be bought and sold and function as normal futures options.
+   ForecastEx instruments cannot be sold, only bought. To exit or reduce a position, one must buy the opposing Event Contract, and IB will net the opposing positions together automatically.

In both cases, no short selling is permitted.

### Executions and Netting

###### Copy Location

Positions in forecast contracts are opened by buying either a YES or NO contract. Positions are reduced or closed by buying the opposite contract at the same strike: NO reduces YES, and YES reduces NO.  
An opening order will receive normal Bought/Bot execution reports (“side”: “B”). However, if an account is already long YES or NO, a reduction of that position will produce a series of execution reports.

For example, consider an account long 100 YES contracts. A new order is submitted to buy 10 NO contracts of the same strike. Execution of this Buy NO order will be netted against the long 100 YES position.

+   Order receives an execution for 10 NO contracts.
+   IB sends an execution report of Bot 10 NO (“side”: “B”). This momentarily creates a long 10 NO position in the account.
+   IB sends an execution report of Netting 10 YES (“side”: “N”). This reduces the long 100 YES position in the account by 10, yielding 90.
+   IB sends an execution report of Netting 10 NO (“side”: “N”). This reduces the long 10 NO position by 10 to 0, flattening it.
+   Net result: Account contains only the long 90 YES position.

The above netting execution reports will arrive within milliseconds of the first Bot execution. IB’s ForecastTrader reflects all such Bot & Netting executions as separate trades in the account’s Trade History.

Note that it is also possible to change the side of a position from YES to NO via a single opposite-side buy order.

For example, consider the same account, now long 90 YES. Another order is submitted to buy 130 NO contracts on the same strike.

+   Order receives an execution for 130 NO contracts.
+   IB sends an execution report of Bot 130 NO (“side”: “B”). This momentarily creates a long 130 NO position in the account.
+   IB sends an execution report of Netting 90 YES (“side”: “N”). This reduces the long 90 YES position in the account to 0, flattening it.
+   IB sends an execution report of Netting 90 NO (“side”: “N”). This reduces the the long 130 NO position by 90, yielding 40.
+   Net result: Account contains only the long 40 NO position.

| Ratios        | R    |
| Shares        | S    |

### Allocation Preset Combinations

###### Copy Location

In order to attain specific allocation behaviors, a combination of various settings must be specified. The tables below detail what settings must be used.Interactive Brokers supports two forms of allocation methods. Allocation methods that have calculations completed by Interactive Brokers, and a set of allocation methods calculated by the user and then specified.

The preset settings are based on the Advisor Presets setting built in TWS.  
Every time a user logs in to TWS, the presets established in the CPAPI will update to reflect the settings in TWS.  
Presets adjusted in the Client Portal API will not adjust the settings in TWS.

### Regulatory Snapshot

###### Copy Location

**WARNING:** Each regulatory snapshot made **will incur a fee of $0.01 USD** to the account. **This applies to both live and paper accounts.**

If you are already paying for, or are subscribed to, a specific US Network subscription, your account will not be charged.

For stocks, there are individual exchange-specific market data subscriptions necessary to receive streaming quotes. For instance, for NYSE stocks this subscription is known as “Network A”, for ARCA/AMEX stocks it is called “Network B” and for NASDAQ stocks it is “Network C”. Each subscription is added a la carte and has a separate market data fee.

Alternatively, there is also a “US Securities Snapshot Bundle” subscription which does not provide streaming data but which allows for real time calculated snapshots of US market NBBO prices. Making a request with this endpoint, the returned value is a calculation of the current market state based on data from all available exchanges.

The following table lists the cost and maximum allocation for regulatory snapshot quotes:

| Listed Network Feed    | Price per reqSnapshot request | Pro or non-Pro | Max reqSnapshot request |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| NYSE (Network A/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Pro            | 4500                    |
| NYSE (Network A/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Non-Pro        | 150                     |
| AMEX (Network B/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Pro            | 2300                    |
| AMEX (Network B/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Non-Pro        | 150                     |
| NASDAQ (Network C/UTP) | 0.01 USD                      | Pro            | 2300                    |
| NASDAQ (Network C/UTP) | 0.01 USD                      | Non-Pro        | 150                     |

### Option Chains

###### Copy Location

Option Chains are not through a singular request. However, they can be retrieved through a specific process in the Client Portal API. The steps below the standard procedure to retrieve a range of option conIds that can be filtered into market data.

### Step One: Instantiate the Option Chain

###### Copy Location

To begin, users must first make a call to the [/iserver/secdef/search endpoint](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#search-symbol-contract) for the underlying symbol. This is required for all future steps every time the user does not know the final derivative’s conId.

**This must always be called before proceeding, even if you are aware of the conId and expiration dates.**

```python
request_url = f"{baseUrl}/iserver/secdef/search?symbol=SPX"
requests.get(url=request_url)
```

```
curl --insecure \
--url https://localhost:5000/v1/api/iserver/secdef/search?symbol=SPX \
--request GET
```

In the response, we are able to see two important values returned. The first, we can find our ConID for the underlying, 416904. We will need this for our future requests.

We can also see under “sections”::”secType”:”OPT, “months” we will see all of the contract expirations months. This will be required to build our option chain in the next request.

```
[
  {
    "conid": "416904",
    "companyHeader": "S&P 500 Stock Index - CBOE",
    "companyName": "S&P 500 Stock Index",
    "symbol": "SPX",
    "description": "CBOE",
    "restricted": "IND",
    "sections": [
      {...},
      {
        "secType": "OPT",
        "months": "JAN24;FEB24;MAR24;APR24;MAY24;JUN24;JUL24;AUG24;SEP24;OCT24;NOV24;DEC24;JAN25;MAR25;JUN25;DEC25;DEC26;DEC27;DEC28;DEC29",
        "exchange": "SMART;CBOE;IBUSOPT"
      },
      {...}
    ]
  }
]
```

### Step Two: Find Potential Strikes

###### Copy Location

After querying the /iserver/secdef/search endpoint, developers should now call the [/iserver/secdef/strikes endpoint](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi/#strike-conid-contract). To receive the appropriate strikes, the conId, secType, and expiration month should be specified.

**This must always be called before proceeding, even if you are aware of the strikes.**

Note: For Futures Options, the conId of the Index should be specified, along with the explicit exchange being listed. As an example, CL futures options should specify “exchange=NYMEX” as an additional query parameter.

```python
request_url = f"{baseUrl}/iserver/secdef/strikes?conid=416904&sectype=OPT&month=JAN25"
requests.get(url=request_url)
```

```
curl \
--url {{baseUrl}}/iserver/secdef/strikes?conid=416904&secType=OPT&month=JAN25 \
--request GET
```

As a response, an object containing arrays of all Call and Put strikes will be returned. This will only return potential strike prices. This does not necessarily indicate. These strikes should be confirmed with our /info endpoint to confirm if the strike is valid.

```
{
  "call": [
    200.0,
  {...},
    7800.0
  ],
  "put": [
    200.0,
  {...},
    7800.0
  ]
}
```

### Step Three: Validate The Contract

###### Copy Location

After calling the /search and /strikes endpoints, users can use the [/iserver/secdef/info endpoint](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi/#secdef-info-contract) to validate the derivative conId. This endpoint should be called for each strike and right combination of interest.

Note: For Futures Options, the conId of the Index should be specified, along with the explicit exchange being listed. As an example, CL futures options should specify “exchange=NYMEX” as an additional query parameter.

```python
request_url = f"{baseUrl}/iserver/secdef/info?conid=416904&secType=OPT&month=JAN25&strike=3975&right=P
requests.get(url=request_url)
```

```
curl \
--url {{baseUrl}}/iserver/secdef/info?conid=416904&secType=OPT&month=JAN25&strike=3975&right=P \
--request GET
```

While all of the information is relevant, it is most important to save the conId in order to track the contract itself. For the lifespan of the Option, this conId will remain constant. This will also be used for all subsequent requests for market data or order placement.

```
[
  {
    "conid": 654371995,
    "symbol": "SPX",
    "secType": "OPT",
    "exchange": "SMART",
    "listingExchange": null,
    "right": "P",
    "strike": 3975.0,
    "currency": "USD",
    "cusip": null,
    "coupon": "No Coupon",
    "desc1": "SPX",
    "desc2": "JAN 16 '25 3975 Put (AM)",
    "maturityDate": "20250116",
    "multiplier": "100",
    "tradingClass": "SPX",
    "validExchanges": "SMART,CBOE,IBUSOPT"
  }
]
```

### Final Steps

###### Copy Location

After confirming all of our interested strikes to retrieve our conIds, we officially have our option chain established. From there, users may be interested to send requests to the [/iserver/marketdata/snapshot endpoint](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi/#md-snapshot) in bulk by comma separating the “conids” list.

Alternatively, users that already are aware of the market data potentially through other means can look to start placing orders using the [/iserver/account/{accountId}/orders endpoint](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi/#place-order).

### Order Monitoring

###### Copy Location

### Live Orders

###### Copy Location

This endpoint requires a pre-flight request.  
Orders is the list of live orders (cancelled, filled, submitted).

To retrieve order information for a specific account, clients must first query the [/iserver/account endpoint](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#switch-account) to switch to the appropriate account.

Please be aware that filtering orders using the /iserver/account/orders endpoint will prevent order details from coming through over the [websocket “sor” topic](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#ws-order-updates-sub). To resolve this issue, developers should set “force=true” in a follow-up /iserver/account/orders call to clear any cached behavior surrounding the endpoint prior to calling for the websocket request.

### Order Status

###### Copy Location

The Order Status endpoint may be used to monitor a single specific order while it remains active.

Important Notes:

+   For multi-account structures such as Financial Advisors or linked-account structures, users must call [/iserver/account](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#switch-account) to switch to the affiliated account before requesting order status. It is otherwise expected to result in a ‘503’ error.
+   If an order has been cancelled or filled prior to the active session and there is no cached information saved, querying the order status endpoint would be expected to result in a ‘503’ error.

Retrieve the given status of an individual order using the orderId returned by the order placement response or the orderId available in the live order response.

### Order Status Value

###### Copy Location

For many orders, customers will see orders return an order status with an array of potential values. The table below elaborates on what the status means for the order and the potential behavior to expect from it.

The values returned from the “order\_status” field of our Live Orders object will vary slightly from the format used while using the “filters” parameter from [GET /iserver/account/orders](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#live-orders).

| Status        | Filter Value    | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inactive      | inactive        | The order is inactive and is not yet transmitted.            |
| PendingSubmit | pending\_submit | Order was received by the system but is no longer active because it was rejected or cancelled. |
| PreSubmitted  | pre\_submitted  | Order has been transmitted but have not received confirmation yet that order accepted by destination exchange or venue. |
| Submitted     | submitted       | Order has been accepted by the system.                       |
| Filled        | filled          | Order has been completely filled.                            |
| PendingCancel | pending\_cancel | Sent an order cancellation request but have not yet received confirmation order cancelled by destination exchange or venue. |
| Cancelled     | cancelled       | The balance of your order has been confirmed canceled by the system. |
| WarnState     | warn\_state     | Order has a specific warning message such as for basket orders. |
| N/A           | sort\_by\_time  | There is an initial sort by order state performed so active orders are always above inactive and filled then orders are sorted chronologically. |

### Orders

###### Copy Location

### Place Order

###### Copy Location

When connected to an IServer Brokerage Session, this endpoint will allow you to submit orders.

CP WEB API supports various advanced orderTypes, for additional details and examples refer to the [Order Types](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/order-types/) page.

**Cash Quantity:** Send orders using monetary value by specifying cashQty instead of quantity, e.g. cashQty: 200. The endpoint /iserver/contract/rules returns list of valid orderTypes in cqtTypes.  
Note: Cash Quantity orders are only supported for Cryptocurrency and Forex contracts.

**Currency Conversion:** Convert cash from one currency to another by including isCcyConv = true. To specify the cash quantity use fxQTY instead of quantity, e.g. fxQTY: 100.

**IB Algos:** Attached user-defined settings to your trades by using any of IBKR’s Algo Orders. Use the endpoint /iserver/contract/{conid}/algos to identify the available strategies for a contract.

**Notes:**

+   With the exception of OCA groups and bracket orders, the orders endpoint does not currently support the placement of unrelated orders in bulk.
+   Developers should not attempt to place another order until the previous order has been fully acknowledged, that is, when no further warnings are received deferring the client to the reply endpoint.

```

### Bracket Orders & OCA Groups

###### Copy Location

The available values and structures of Bracket or OCA orders follow the same general structure of individual orders. Bracket and OCA orders require a parent order be submitted, and then each leg, or child order, would include the parent’s order ID.

Bracket orders can be submitted sequentially using the default order\_id created by Interactive Brokers.

OR

Bracket orders can be submitted using the cOID field for the parent order, and then use this same value in each of the child orders in the parentId field.

The body content on the right represents a standard bracket order which contains a parent order, a profit taker, and a stop loss. As you can see, the only addition to this order is the inclusion of cOID in the parent order, and the parentId field in the two children.

```
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "acctId": "U1234567",
      "conid": 265598,
      "cOID": "Parent",
      "orderType": "MKT",
      "listingExchange": "SMART",
      "outsideRTH": true,
      "side": "Buy",
      "referrer": "QuickTrade",
      "tif": "GTC",
      "quantity": 50
    },
    {
      "acctId": "U1234567",
      "conid": 265598,
      "orderType": "STP",
      "listingExchange": "SMART",
      "outsideRTH": false,
      "price": 157.30,
      "side": "Sell",
      "tif": "GTC",
      "quantity": 50,
      "parentId": "Parent"
    },
    {
      "acctId": "U1234567",
      "conid": 265598,
      "orderType": "LMT",
      "listingExchange": "SMART",
      "outsideRTH": false,
      "price": 157.00,
      "side": "Sell",
      "tif": "GTC",
      "quantity": 50,
      "parentId": "Parent"
    }
  ]
}
```

An OCA group will follow this same structure. However, in addition to the standard bracket, each order will include `"isSingleGroup": true`. Otherwise, no additional modifications need to be made.

```

  "orders": [
    {
      "acctId": "U1234567",

### Combo / Spread Orders

###### Copy Location

Combination orders or spread orders may also be placed using the same orders endpoint. In the case of combo orders, we must use the ‘conidex’ instead of “conid”. The conidex field is a string representation of our combo order parameters.

**Combo Orders follow the format of: ‘{spread\_conid};;;{leg\_conid1}/{ratio},{leg\_conid2}/{ratio}‘**

The spread\_conid is a unique identified used to denote a spread order.  For US Stock Combos, only the spread\_conid needs to be submitted.. For all other countries, you will need to use the format ‘spread\_conid@exchange’.

###### *Available currency spread conids:*

| Currency | Spread ConID |
| -------- | ------------ |
| AUD      | 61227077     |
| CAD      | 61227082     |
| CHF      | 61227087     |
| CNH      | 136000441    |
| GBP      | 58666491     |
| HKD      | 61227072     |
| INR      | 136000444    |
| JPY      | 61227069     |
| KRW      | 136000424    |
| MXN      | 136000449    |
| SEK      | 136000429    |
| SGD      | 426116555    |
| USD      | 28812380     |

Following our spread\_conid, we will then follow with 3 semicolons, and then the first leg\_coind. This will be the first contract to trade. After the conid, a forward slash, ‘/’, needs to be included followed by your spread ratio.

The ratio indicates two parts. The first is the sign of the ratio, whether it is positive or negative. Positive signs indicate a ‘Buy’ side, while a negative value represents a ‘Sell’ side. This could also be explained as a state of ‘Long’ and ‘Short’ respectively, depending on your current position and intention. After indicating the side, you would indicate the ratio value. This is the multiplier of your quantity value.

Now, you can continue to add legs to the order by separating them with a comma. The number of legs available is based on the exchange’s rules.

#### Combo Order Pricing

Combo orders can submit their price values based on the value of the individual leg, multiplied by the ratio. Each leg is then added together to create the final price of the order.

These prices can end as negative values if one of the legs is being sold and the total value of that leg multiplied by the ratio is greater than the value of the other order.

The price of a combo order = \[({Cost of Leg 1} \* {The ratio of Leg 1}) + ({Cost of Leg n} \* {Ratio of Leg n}) + ({Cost of Leg n+1} \* {Ratio of Leg n+1})\]

## Websockets

###### Copy Location

Websocket topics expose the same underlying data as is delivered by the HTTP endpoints. Functionality that requires a brokerage session (that is, all features behind /iserver URIs) will also require a brokerage session when accessed via websocket. Please ensure you have an active brokerage session before attempting to use these features of the websocket. For information on getting started with Client Portal API, please refer to the [Authentication](#authentication) section.

Websocket topics requiring a brokerage session: smd (live market data), smh (historical market data), sbd (live price ladder data), sor (order updates), str (trades), act (unsolicited account property info), sts (unsolicited brokerage session authentication status), blt (unsolicited bulletins), ntf (unsolicited notifications).

Websocket topics that do not require a brokerage session: spl (profit & loss updates), ssd (account summary updates), sld (account ledger updates), system (unsolicited connection-related messages).

The url for websockets is: **wss://localhost:5000/v1/api/ws**

### Connection Guide

###### Copy Location

If you require brokerage functionality, you will need to establish a brokerage session prior to opening a websocket, just as is required before making requests to /iserver endpoints. Please see [Authentication](#authentication) for more details.

### Request Session Information

###### Copy Location

First make request the [/tickle](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi/#tickle) endpoint and save the returned session value.

```
{
    "session": "d21b8cf5ebc8ea01c6ce37c8125ec83f",
    "ssoExpires": ssoExpires,
    "collission": collission,
    "userId": userId,
    "hmds": {
        "error": "no bridge"
    },
    "iserver": {
        "authStatus": {
            "authenticated": true,
            "competing": false,
            "connected": true,
            "message": "",
            "MAC": "MAC",
            "serverInfo": {
                "serverName": "serverName",
                "serverVersion": "serverVersion"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Retrieve the Session Token

###### Copy Location

We are then specifically interested in the “session” value in the response as we can pass this to our websocket for confirming our sessionId.

```
sessionToken = '{"session":"d21b8cf5ebc8ea01c6ce37c8125ec83f"}'
```

### Establishing the Websocket with Client Portal Gateway

###### Copy Location

Next, you will need to build your websocket to wss://localhost:5000/v1/api/ws. In your request to establish the websocket, be sure to set your cookie header as “api={‘session’ value here}”

```python
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
  url="wss://localhost:5000/v1/api/ws",
  on_open=on_open,
  on_message=on_message,
  on_error=on_error,
  on_close=on_close,
  cookie=f"api={sessionToken}"
)
ws.run_forever()
```

```
curl -i -k -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "origin: interactivebrokers.github.io" --cookie "api=d21b8cf5ebc8ea01c6ce37c8125ec83f" wss://localhost:5000/v1/api/ws
```

### Establishing the Websocket with OAuth

###### Copy Location

The process for those authenticating with OAuth is similar, though slightly different. In addition to the API cookie, you must also include the “oauth\_token” query param which should be set to the user’s access token value.

```python
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
  url="wss://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/ws?oauth_token={accessToken}",
  on_open=on_open,
  on_message=on_message,
  on_error=on_error,
  on_close=on_close,
  cookie=f"api={sessionToken}"
)
ws.run_forever()
```

```
curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "origin: interactivebrokers.github.io" --cookie "api=d21b8cf5ebc8ea01c6ce37c8125ec83f" wss://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/ws?oauth_token={Access Token}
```

### Send a Websocket Topic

###### Copy Location

After establishing your session, you may send whichever topics are needed through the newly established websocket. 

```python
on_open(ws):
    print("Opened Connection")
    time.sleep(3)
    ws.send('smd+265598+{"fields":["31","84","86"]}')
```

Please note that while the websocket session itself supports the ability to establish a websocket, cURL is unable to send future topic requests. This would need to be facilitated by either a third party terminal add-on, or a programming language such as Python, Java, or otherwise.

### Solicited and Unsolicited Messages

###### Copy Location

There are two types of messages sent to clients via the websocket:

+   **Solicited messages:** Messages delivered to the client in response to an explicit, client-initiated subscription to a topic.
+   **Unsolicited messages:** Messages delivered automatically to the client by the server. These messages are not associated with a topic subscription that can be canceled, and they typically contain session or other administrative information.

### Subscribing to Websocket Topics

###### Copy Location

Most data available via the websocket is delivered as a stream of messages in response to an explicit subscription to a topic. Such subscription messages are solicited, because the client must first ask to be subscribed to the relevant topic before messages will be sent by the server. To subscribe to a topic, a message is sent to the websocket in the following format:

**TOPIC+\[TOPIC\_TARGET\]+{PARAMETERS}**

where:

+   **TOPIC** is the identifier of the topic (the type of data) to be subscribed.
+   The plus symbol **+** is used as a separator of the message elements.
+   **TOPIC\_TARGET** identifies a specific resource, typically an account or instrument, as the subject of the subscription. Certain topics do not use a target.
+   **{PARAMETERS}** is a JSON-formatted string that describes filters or other modifiers to the topic subscription. If no parameters are available for the topic, or none are desired for your subscription, this is sent as an empty {} object.

Solicited message topics are generally three characters in length. A message sent to subscribe, as well as the messages received in response for the duration of the subscription, will use a topic starting with **s** (“subscribe”). The second two characters identify the particular datafeed in question, as in topic **ssd**, indicating “subscribe” + “account summary”.

When canceling a subscription (unsubscribing), a message is sent using a topic starting with **u** (“unsubscribe”), followed by the two-character identifier of the datafeed whose subscription will be terminated, as in topic **usd**, indicating “unsubscribe” + “account summary”.

### Miscellaneous Operations

###### Copy Location

### Exercise Options

###### Copy Location

The operation to exercise via Client Portal is quite involved, and requires that users confirm details across multiple websocket requests.

To initiate the process, developers must make a handshake request passing the “exercise” argument. Then, users will pass in their Option’s ConID to the “CEX” field.

Developers should also maintain [Live Order Updates](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#ws-order-updates-sub) while exercising options to confirm final results.

```
shs+exercise+{"CEX":"Your_Option_Conid"}
```

This will initially respond with the acknowledgement of the topic.

You will then receive additional messages about the available options to proceed with, including “Cancel” or “Submit”. This will also offer contract information, position information, and an ID to track the request with.

We may also receive a warning notification about this Option exercise, such as in-the-money warnings. This do not need to be suppressed or replied to; however, they should be noted by the trader as they come through.

```
{"topic":"shs+exercise"}

{"data":{"user_action":[{"id":"submit","text":"Submit"},{"id":"cancel","text":"Cancel"}],"underlying_price":"$211.35","contract":"**AAPL** JUN 28 '24 192.5 Call","underlying_symbol":"AAPL","exercise":{"confirm":false,"confirm_final":false,"enabled":true},"revocable":false,"loading":true,"hold":{"confirm":false,"enabled":true},"qty_lapse":0,"submitted":0,"qty_hold":0,"sec_type":"OPT","qty_exercise":0,"underlying_conid":"265598","morning_expiration":false,"id":5,"position":50,"deadline":"16:25"},"action":"content","MID":"14","topic":"shs+exercise"}

{"data":{"submitted":0,"qty_hold":0,"qty_exercise":0,"warning":"Currently the option is in-the-money by the amount of 18.85 (more than 5 ticks)","exercise":{"confirm":false,"enabled":true},"revocable":false,"loading":false,"qty_lapse":0},"action":"content","MID":"17","topic":"shs+exercise"}
```

After receiving our second listed message above, we can construct our exercise request. This will use the “inp” topic, along with the exercise argument once again.

Within the brackets, we will pass the “user\_input” as our action, and then the data field will contian the order parameters. This will include our ID, which we retrieved from our prior shs+exercise response. We’ll then pass “submit” as our user\_action, and then pass our exercise options.

The critical values to observe here are whether you would like your exercise to be final, with “make\_final”:true. We also submit our quantity of options to exercise with the “value” parameter. In this case, we are exercising 5 shares.

```
inp+exercise+{"action":"user_input","data":{"id":"5","user_action":"submit","exercise":{"allowed":"not_shown","make_final":true,"value":5}}}
```

If there are any additional confirmation/warnings then they will be provided on a new message, including a new “id” value.

```
{"data":{"user_actions":[{"id":"continue","text":"Continue"},{"id":"cancel","text":"Cancel"}],"id":7,"text":"This exercise request will be final and irreversible. Once submitted, the option position and the stock position will update immediately.","title":"Warning"},"MID":"19","action":"prompt","topic":"inp+exercise"}
```

As we noticed above, we now would need to request that our exercise continue for id 7 again using the inp+exercise topic.

```
inp+exercise+{"action":"user_input","data":{"id":"7","user_action":"continue"}
```

Once the developer submits the new ID with “continue” as their user\_action, they will see the order submitted in the SOR websocket.

```

## OAuth 1.0a

###### Copy Location

### Introduction

###### Copy Location

Interactive Brokers offers an OAuth 1.0a authentication procedure for licensed Financial Advisors, Organizations, IBrokers, and third party services. Beyond the initial authentication procedure, the OAuth implementation will behave the same as the standard [Client Portal API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi/) and it’s endpoints.

Authentication via tokens produced by our OAuth 1.0a workflow permits requests to be made directly to `https://api.ibkr.com`, without the need for any intermediary software such as the Client Portal Gateway. Resource paths remain the same regardless of the method of authentication.

Interactive Brokers makes a distinction between first-party use of OAuth directly by clients and third-party use of OAuth by vendors of software, described below.

### First Party Oauth

###### Copy Location

Interactive Brokers classifies first party entities as institutions that will be trading on behalf of themselves or their institution. The same entity developing with the API platform will be the same entity that will be using it for trading.

Examples of first party entities include financial advisors, hedge funds, and organizations looking to trade their own capital.

For interested first party candidates, please email apiintegration@interactivebrokers.com with the following questions answered.

1.  What do you intend to do with OAuth access?
2.  Please list all accounts that will use the developed OAuth program.
3.  Will the client application be developed in-house or by a third-party developer?

Approved groups using First Party OAuth will need to use the Self Service Portal in order to generate their consumer key, encryption keys, and access tokens. This link will be provided directly to approved entities during the onboarding process. This is an essential step in creating your program and following the steps listed below.

Registering a Consumer Key via the Self-Service Portal will not be valid until after the Friday/Saturday evening reset. Attempting to use the new Consumer Key prior to the reset will result in an error (you may receive a 401 Invalid Consumer error).

### First Party OAuth Workflow

###### Copy Location

### Third Party OAuth

###### Copy Location

Interactive Brokers classifies third party entities as any organization offering a platform or medium of trading to individuals outside of the organization. Please note that interested groups that would like to register as a third party with Interactive Brokers must have an established platform with other brokerage firms, or a full proof of concept with an integration using the Client Portal API.

Examples of this would include auto-traders or robo-advisors, public mobile applications, and groups forwarding market data.

For organizations that meet the criteria above and have an interest in integrating with Interactive Brokers, we would ask that you please email [api-solutions@interactivebrokers.com](mailto:api-solutions@interactivebrokers.com).

To give you a sense for the process ahead:

1.  Our onboarding team conducts the initial vetting process. Once we have collected a sufficient amount of information, we will complete a preliminary review. Estimated time to complete this step is 2-3 weeks. Assuming we are able to proceed, we will send your application to our Compliance team for review.
2.  IBKR Compliance conducts an enhanced due diligence review on all third party applicants, followed by a three tier approval process. Estimated time to complete Compliance related reviews and tasks is 3-6 weeks.
3.  If Compliance approval is reached, our Legal team will generate the WebAPI agreement which we will send to you for review and signature. In parallel, we will ask you to provide public keys and a CallbackURL which will be required in to generate your consumer key and finalize the setup. Detailed instructions for this process will be provided once we reach this stage. Estimated time for our side to complete the aforementioned work and processes is 3-5 weeks.

The above timelines are all estimations and can vary. We recommend providing as much information as possible up front. Not doing so can exaggerate timelines.

During the enhanced due diligence reviews conducted by our Compliance teams, they will expect to see that 3rd Party Vendors looking to offer their services to our clients have a completed website with details on all of the features/services that will be provided and finalized details on their offering. This typically includes a clear user work flow for all components and details on their functionality, capability.

As mentioned previously, should Compliance approval be reached we would be able to generate a live consumer key for you and any significant changes to the offering after it has been approved (like addition of trading functionality) would require additional review and approval from our Compliance Teams before being offered to IBKR clients.

Please be aware we expect 3rd Parties offering automated trading solutions would hold applicable registration with financial authority in all regions they plan offer the service, unless you are able to provide support (i.e. a legal opinion) as to why the business provided would not require registration that location. Additionally, the offering will need to be reviewed and approved by Compliance teams in all regions you intend to support IBKR clients.

The above timelines are all estimations and can vary. We recommend providing as much information as possible up front. Not doing so can exaggerate timelines.

### Third Party OAuth Workflow

###### Copy Location

Once approved for Third Party OAuth, developers must use the supplied certificates and consumer key to register, authorize, and generate an access token for a user before they are able to retrieve a live session token for [Authenticated Requests With OAuth 1.0A](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#standard-oauth).

### Understanding TESTCONS

###### Copy Location

When onboarding new clients, Support may often recommend getting started with the TESTCONS consumer key.

+   TESTCONS is a Third Party Consumer Key, and in order to register it, developers must initially follow the third party workflow.
    +   For First Party developers, please utilize one of the provided samples to register the consumer key with your user. After registration, you may reserve the Access Token and Access Token Secret to follow the standard First party OAuth implementation.
+   This consumer key is only available for Paper Trading Accounts. Attempts to register this consumer key with a live account will result in an error.
+   Third Party consumer keys will register to an account immediately. As a result, TESTCONS will be immediately usable for any registered client, regardless of whether the individual is applying for a first party or third party consumer key.

### Request Token

###### Copy Location

For Third Party OAuth users to start the OAuth process, we must first get a request token.

To get a request token, an OAuth request to `https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/oauth/request_token` must be made.

The request should be a POST request but with no body. Remember that [an authorization header](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/oauth-1a/#auth-header) has to be authorize the connection.

This step is a good indicator of whether or not something is wrong with your OAuth request. If you are missing any portion of the authorization header, the response will tell you so. If something is wrong with either the base string or signature creation, then you will be met with a 401 response.

**Important:** If you are a First Party OAuth users, do not follow this step. You will receive an error. For developers implementing First Party OAuth, proceed directly to [Requesting the Live Session Token](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#lst).

### Endpoint

###### Copy Location

**Note** we do not return an oauth\_token\_secret in the response as we are using RSA signatures rather than PLAINTEXT authentication.

```

### Response

###### Copy Location

**oauth\_token:** String.  
Resulting request token used as an encoded authentication value.

Be sure to save the request token for your next two requests.

After receiving your access token, this value will no longer be used.

```
{
  "oauth_token": "b9082d68cfef06b030de"
}
```

### Authorization

###### Copy Location

After retrieving our request token, we need to authorize the value against the Interactive Brokers server. This is done by directing users to https://interactivebrokers.com/authorize?oauth\_token={{ REQUEST\_TOKEN }} where they will log in with their Interactive Brokers credentials. Because we are using “oob” as our callback url, users will be presented with an error page.

Replace REQUEST\_TOKEN with the request token you generated

After the user logs in, they will be redirected to a URL specified during consumer key creation, and there will be two query parameters in the URL:  
oauth\_token and oauth\_verifier

oauth\_token is the request token, and oauth\_verifier is the verifier token required for the next step.

An example of url after the user logs in `http://localhost:20000/?oauth_token=b9082d68cfef06b030de&oauth_verifier=0ffb93ab9aa0d2177cc2`

**Important:** If you are a First Party OAuth users, do not follow this step. You will receive an error. For developers implementing First Party OAuth, proceed directly to [Requesting the Live Session Token](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#lst).

### Endpoint

###### Copy Location

Direct the client to the Interactive Brokers authorize uri where they can then log in to establish the request token to their user.

###### Copy Location

For our programmatic implementation without an official callback url, we can introduce a simple line to direct the user to the login page and save the verifier token for later.

```
url = f'https://interactivebrokers.com/authorize?oauth_token={rToken}'
vToken = input(f"Please log in to {url} and paste the 'oauth_verifier' value here: ")
```

### Response

###### Copy Location

A successful login will direct them to the callback url, which displays both the oauth\_token (request token) and the oauth\_verifier (verifier token). This can be pasted back to our original request, and saved as a variable for the Access Token request.

![Callback URL displayed in browser](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)

### Access Token

###### Copy Location

A POST request to https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/oauth/access\_token must now be made.

This time, oauth\_verifier must be added to the authorization header, with the value being the verifier token retrieved from the previous step.

oauth\_token must also be added to the authorization header, the value being [the request token](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#request-token).

If the request succeeds, the response will contain two values: oauth\_token and oauth\_token\_secret.

The oauth\_token in the response is the access token, and the oauth\_token\_secret will be used for the next step.

**Important:** If you are a First Party OAuth users, do not follow this step. You will receive an error The access token and access token secret would otherwise be retrieved through the Self Service Portal. For developers implementing First Party OAuth, proceed directly to [Requesting the Live Session Token](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#lst).

### Endpoint

###### Copy Location

The Access Token endpoint will be used to return the Access Token and Access Token Secret values to be used for all requests moving forward as an identifier of the user with our consumer key.

An Access Token will remain the same whenever a username is generated with a given consumer key; however, the access token secret will be unique upon each generation.

`POST /oauth/access_token`

### Live Session Token

###### Copy Location

The final step in the OAuth authorization process is the live session token. This is the final stage of authorizing your user for each session. In this step we must calculate a Diffie-Hellman challenge using the prime and generator in the Diffie-Hellman spec provided when registering your consumer key.

If you are an IB customer who registered using the Self-Service OAuth page then on that same page you should have completed [the Access Token step](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#access-token). You would now proceed to this final step to complete the OAuth authorization process.

### Endpoint

###### Copy Location

The live session token will allow the user to access their API, for trading or for portfolio access, over a 24 hour period. The creation of the Live Session Token does not establish a complete trading session, as that would be handled by [Initializing the Brokerage Session](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/oauth-1a/#init-session).

`POST /oauth/live_session_token`

### Diffie-Hellman Random Value

###### Copy Location

The Diffie-Hellman random value is simply any positive random 256-bit integer value.

This will be used immediately for the Diffie-Hellman challenge as well as the computation of the live session token.

```python
dh_random = str(random.getrandbits(256))
```

```
Random random = new();

BigInteger dh_random = random.Next(1, int.MaxValue);
```

### Diffie-Hellman Challenge

###### Copy Location

The Diffie-Hellman challenge value is the quotient of modulus division, converted to a hex string. Using ‘2’ as our generator, raised to the power of our Diffie-Hellman random value, divided by our Diffie-Hellman Prime or Modulus value.

```python
# Replace with path to DH param PEM file.
with open("./dhparam.pem, "r") as f:
    dh_param = RSA.importKey(f.read())
    dh_prime = dh_param.n # Also known as DH Modulus
    dh_generator = dh_param.e  # always =2

# Convert result to hex and remove leading 0x chars.
dh_challenge = hex(pow(base=dh_generator, exp=dh_random, mod=dh_prime))[2:]
```

```
// Extract our dh_modulus and dh_generator values from our dhparam.pem file's bytes.
AsnReader asn1Seq = new AsnReader(dh_der_data, AsnEncodingRules.DER).ReadSequence();
BigInteger dh_modulus = asn1Seq.ReadInteger();
BigInteger dh_generator = asn1Seq.ReadInteger();

// Generate our dh_challenge value by calculating the result of our generator to the power of our random value, modular divided by our dh_modulus.
BigInteger dh_challenge = BigInteger.ModPow(dh_generator, dh_random, dh_modulus);
```

### Prepend

###### Copy Location

We can find the prepend by first converting our access token secret to a bytestring. We then decrypt the bytestring using our private encryption key as an RSA key with PKCS1v1.5 padding. The prepend is the resulting bytestring converted to a hex string value.

```python
# Replace with path to private encryption key file.
with open("./private_encrpytion.pem", "r") as f:
    encryption_key = RSA.importKey(f.read())

bytes_decrypted_secret = PKCS1_v1_5_Cipher.new(
    key=encryption_key
    ).decrypt(
        ciphertext=base64.b64decode(access_token_secret), 
        sentinel=None,
        )
prepend = bytes_decrypted_secret.hex()
```

```
// Create the crypto provider 
RSACryptoServiceProvider bytes_decrypted_secret = new()
{
  // Utililze a keysize of 2048 rather than the default 7168
  KeySize = 2048
};

StreamReader sr = new("./private_encryption.pem");
string reader = sr.ReadToEnd();
sr.Close();

// Find the pem field content from the StreamReader string
PemFields pem_fields = PemEncoding.Find(reader);

// Convert the pem base 64 string content into a byte array for use in our import
byte[] der_data = Convert.FromBase64String(reader[pem_fields.Base64Data]);

// Import the bytes object as our key
bytes_decrypted_secret.ImportPkcs8PrivateKey(der_data, out _);

// Encode the access token secret as an ASCII bytes object
byte[] encryptedSecret = Convert.FromBase64String(access_token_secret);

// Decrypt our secret bytes with the encryption key
byte[] raw_prepend = bytes_decrypted_secret.Decrypt(encryptedSecret, RSAEncryptionPadding.Pkcs1);

// Convert our bytestring to a hexadecimal string
string prepend = Convert.ToHexString(raw_prepend).ToLower();
```

### Encoded Base String

###### Copy Location

The Encoded Base String for the Live Session Token is composed of the Prepend, Method, “&”, URL, “&”, and OAuth params combined as a sorted string.

Both the URL and the parameter string **must** be URI escaped according to [Rfc3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).

```python
params_string = "&".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in sorted(oauth_params.items())])
method = 'POST'
url = f'https://{baseUrl}/oauth/live_session_token'
base_string = f"{prepend}{method}&{quote_plus(url)}&{quote(params_string)}"
encoded_base_string = base_string.encode("utf-8")
```

```
// Sort our oauth_params dictionary by key.
Dictionary<string, string> sorted_params = oauth_params.OrderBy(pair => pair.Key).ToDictionary(pair => pair.Key, pair => pair.Value);

// Combine our oauth_params into a single string for our base_string.
string params_string = string.Join("&", sorted_params.Select(kv => $"{kv.Key}={kv.Value}"));

// Create a base string by combining the prepend, url, and params string.
string base_string = $"{prepend.ToLower()}POST&{EscapeUriDataStringRfc3986(lst_url)}&{EscapeUriDataStringRfc3986(params_string)}";

// Convert our new string to a bytestring 
byte[] encoded_base_string = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(base_string);
```

### OAuth Signature

###### Copy Location

Creating the OAuth Signature is a multi-stage process.

1.  First uses will need to create a sha256 hash of the encoded base string
2.  Next, you will need to create a PKCS1 v1.5 ([Rfc2313](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2313)) bytestring signature using your Private Encryption Key as an RSA key to sign our sha256 hash value created in our prior step.
3.  Once your bytestring has been generated, we will need to Base 64 encode our bytes, and then decode them using UTF-8 to receive a string value.
4.  Finally, we will need to URI escape our string, again using [Rfc3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), to receive our final oauth\_signature value.

```python
# Generate SHA256 hash of base string bytestring.
sha256_hash = SHA256.new(data=encoded_base_string)

# Generate bytestring PKCS1v1.5 signature of base string hash.
# RSA signing key is private signature key.
bytes_pkcs115_signature = PKCS1_v1_5_Signature.new(
    rsa_key=signature_key
    ).sign(msg_hash=sha256_hash)

# Generate str from base64-encoded bytestring signature.
b64_str_pkcs115_signature = base64.b64encode(bytes_pkcs115_signature).decode("utf-8")

# URL-encode the base64 signature str and add to oauth params dict.
oauth_params['oauth_signature'] = quote_plus(b64_str_pkcs115_signature)
```

```
// Create a Sha256 Instance
SHA256 sha256_inst = SHA256.Create();

// Generate SHA256 hash of base string bytestring.
byte[] sha256_hash = sha256_inst.ComputeHash(encoded_base_string);

// Create the crypto provider for our signature
RSACryptoServiceProvider bytes_pkcs115_signature = new()
{
    // Utililze a keysize of 2048 rather than the default 7168
    KeySize = 2048
};

// Use our function to retrieve the object bytes
StreamReader sr = new(signature_fp);
string reader = sr.ReadToEnd();
sr.Close();

// Find the pem field content from the StreamReader string
PemFields pem_fields = PemEncoding.Find(reader);

// Convert the pem base 64 string content into a byte array for use in our import
byte[] sig_der_data = Convert.FromBase64String(reader[pem_fields.Base64Data]);

// Import the bytes object as our key
bytes_pkcs115_signature.ImportPkcs8PrivateKey(sig_der_data, out _);

//Generate the Pkcs115 signature key
RSAPKCS1SignatureFormatter rsaFormatter = new(bytes_pkcs115_signature);

rsaFormatter.SetHashAlgorithm("SHA256");

//Receive the bytestring of our signature
byte[] signedHash = rsaFormatter.CreateSignature(sha256_hash);

// Convert the bytestring signature to base64.
string b64_str_pkcs115_signature = Convert.ToBase64String(signedHash);

// URL-encode the base64 signature str and add to oauth params dict.
oauth_params.Add("oauth_signature", EscapeUriDataStringRfc3986(b64_str_pkcs115_signature));
```

### Realm

###### Copy Location

The realm is a required oauth parameter. The realm will only ever be one of two values.

If you are using the “TESTCONS” consumer key during your paper testing, you will need to use “test\_realm”

```python
# Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params["realm"] = "test_realm"
```

```
// Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params.Add("realm", :"test_realm");
```

Once you are using your own consumer key, you must use “limited\_poa”.

```python
# Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params["realm"] = "limited_poa"
```

```
// Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params.Add("realm", :"limited_poa");
```

### Authorization Header

###### Copy Location

The Authorization Header compiles our full OAuth parameters into an alphabetically-sorted string.

+   Each key/value pair must be added in the format ‘key=\\”value\\”, where each value is surrounded with quotes
+   Each pair separated with a comma.
+   The string must be prepended with “OAuth “.

The final string should be added as a header for your request using the “Authorization” header.

```python
# Assemble oauth params into auth header value as comma-separated str.
oauth_header = "OAuth " + ", ".join([f'{k}="{v}"' for k, v in sorted(oauth_params.items())])

# Create dict for LST request headers including OAuth Authorization header.
headers = {"Authorization": oauth_header}
```

```
Dictionary fin_sorted_params = oauth_params.OrderBy(pair => pair.Key).ToDictionary(pair => pair.Key, pair => pair.Value);

// Assemble oauth params into auth header value as comma-separated str.
string oauth_header = $"OAuth " + string.Join(", ", fin_sorted_params.Select(kv => $"{kv.Key}=\"{kv.Value}\""));

// Add our Authorization header to our request's header container.
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", oauth_header);
```

### Required Headers

###### Copy Location

In order to make a successful request, several headers must be included. Some libraries and modules may automatically include these values, though they must always be received by Interactive Brokers in order to successfully process request.

+   Accept: This must be set to “\*/\*”
+   Accept-Encoding: This must be set to “gzip,deflate”
+   Authorization: See our prior [Authorization Header](#lst-auth-header) step.
+   Connection: This must be set to “keep-alive”.
+   Host: This must be set to “api.ibkr.com”
+   User-Agent: This may be anything, though the browser identifier or request language is suggested.

```python
# Add User-Agent header, required for all requests. Can have any value.
headers = {
    "Authorization":oauth_header,
    "User-Agent":"python/3.11"
}
```

```
// Build out our request headers
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", oauth_header);
request.Headers.Add("Accept", "*/*");
request.Headers.Add("Accept-Encoding", "gzip,deflate");
request.Headers.Add("Connection", "keep-alive");
request.Headers.Add("Host", "api.ibkr.com");
request.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "csharp/6.0");
```

```
{
  "diffie_hellman_response": "62933e{...}d64d6db34d",
"live_session_token_signature": "9bd5922b2b79effef23c6fb03cc715dcdc8d6219",
"live_session_token_expiration": 1700691802316
}
```

### Computing The Live Session Token

###### Copy Location

From the [Live Session Token Response Object](#lst-response), we only received the Diffie-Hellman response, live session token signature, and live session token expiration values. We now need to use the signature and response values in order to compute our live session token.

### Prepend Bytes

###### Copy Location

We first need to convert our Prepend hex string value into bytes. This will be used to generate a HMAC Hash later.

```python
# Generate bytestring from prepend hex str.
prepend_bytes = bytes.fromhex(prepend)
```

```
//Generate bytestring from prepend hex str.
byte[] prepend_bytes = Convert.FromHexString(prepend);
```

### Calculating K

###### Copy Location

To calculate our live session token, we need to use modulus division to receive a K value for a HMAC hash.

Begin by pulling the base value, B, which will be our dh\_response value from our /live\_session\_token response, using a leading 0 as a sign bit for the hex string.

We will then need to retrieve a BigInteger value of the dh\_response value.

Our exponent value would be equivalent to the same dh\_random value used for our /live\_session\_token request.

Our modulus, p, would be the same as our dh\_modulus or dh\_prime value from our Diffie-Hellman file.

We would finally calculate K using the formula B^a modulo p.

```python
# K will be used to hash the prepend bytestring (the decrypted access token) to produce the LST.
B = int(dh_response, 16)
a = dh_random
p = dh_prime
K = pow(B, a, p)

```

```
// Validate that our dh_response value has a leading sign bit, and if it's not there then be sure to add it.
if (dh_response[0] != 0)
{
    dh_response = "0" + dh_response;
}

// Convert our dh_response hex string to a biginteger. 
BigInteger B = BigInteger.Parse(dh_response, NumberStyles.HexNumber);

BigInteger a = dh_random;
BigInteger p = dh_modulus;

// K will be used to hash the prepend bytestring (the decrypted access token) to produce the LST.
BigInteger K = BigInteger.ModPow(B, a, p);
```

Once K is receive, convert the integer to its hex string representation before converting it to a byte array. In some cases, the resultant K value will have an odd number of leading characters that should be prepended by an additional 0.

```python
# Generate hex string representation of integer K.
hex_str_K = hex(K)[2:]

# If hex string K has odd number of chars, add a leading 0, because all Python hex bytes must contain two hex digits  (0x01 not 0x1).
if len(hex_str_K) % 2:
    print("adding leading 0 for even number of chars")
    hex_str_K = "0" + hex_str_K

# Generate hex bytestring from hex string K.
hex_bytes_K = bytes.fromhex(hex_str_K)

# Prepend a null byte to hex bytestring K if lacking sign bit.
if len(bin(K)[2:]) % 8 == 0:
    hex_bytes_K = bytes(1) + hex_bytes_K
```

```
// Generate hex string representation of integer K. Be sure to strip the leading sign bit.
string hex_str_k = K.ToString("X").ToLower(); // It must be converted to lowercase values prior to byte conversion.

// If hex string K has odd number of chars, add a leading 0
if (hex_str_k.Length % 2 != 0)
{
    // Set the lead byte to 0 for a positive sign bit.
    hex_str_k = "0" + hex_str_k;
}

// Generate hex bytestring from hex string K.
byte[] hex_bytes_K = Convert.FromHexString(hex_str_k);
```

### Final Live Session Calculation

###### Copy Location

To calculate the Live Session Token, we need to create a new HMAC Sha1 object, using the K hex bytes as a key. We then hash our HMAC Sha1 object against our prepend byte string.

The final byte array, converted to a Base64 string, is the computed live session token.

```python
bytes_hmac_hash_K = HMAC.new(
    key=hex_bytes_K,
    msg=prepend_bytes,
    digestmod=SHA1,
    ).digest()
# The computed LST is the base64-encoded HMAC hash of the hex prepend bytestring. Converted here to str.
computed_lst = base64.b64encode(bytes_hmac_hash_K).decode("utf-8")
```

```
// Create HMAC SHA1 object
HMACSHA1 bytes_hmac_hash_K = new()
{
    // Set the HMAC key to our passed intended_key byte array
    Key = hex_bytes_K
};
// Hash the SHA1 bytes of our key against the msg content.
byte[] K_hash = bytes_hmac_hash_K.ComputeHash(prepend_bytes);

// Convert hash to base64 to retrieve the computed live session token.
string computed_lst = Convert.ToBase64String(K_hash);
```

### Validate Live Session Token

###### Copy Location

It should be noted that this step may be skipped for your final product, though it is essential during initial development stages to validate implementation.

After calculating our Live Session Token, the calculation may be validated through the following steps to re-calculate the lst\_signature value retrieved from the /live\_session\_token endpoint. If the calculated value matches the return value, then we have a valid live session token. If the two do not match, there is an issue in your LST generation process.

Begin by converting the computed live session token value to a base64 decoded byte array.

Next, retrieve the UTF-8 byte array equivalent of our consumer key.

Create a new HMAC Sha1 object, using the decoded live session token as a key. We then hash our HMAC Sha1 object against our consumer key byte string.

Convert the resultant byte array to a hex string.

If our new hex string matches the received lst\_signature value, then our computed\_lst value may be used as the live\_session\_token in future requests. If the two are different, then there may be an issue in the live\_session\_token generation process.

```python
# Generate hex-encoded str HMAC hash of consumer key bytestring.
# Hash key is base64-decoded LST bytestring, method is SHA1.
hex_str_hmac_hash_lst = HMAC.new(
    key=base64.b64decode(computed_lst),
    msg=consumer_key.encode("utf-8"),
    digestmod=SHA1,
).hexdigest()

# If our hex hash of our computed LST matches the LST signature received in response, we are successful.
if hex_str_hmac_hash_lst == lst_signature:
    live_session_token = computed_lst
    print("Live session token computation and validation successful.")
    print(f"LST: {live_session_token}; expires: {datetime.fromtimestamp(lst_expiration/1000)}\n")
else:
    print(f"ERROR: LST validation failed.")
```

```
//Generate hex - encoded str HMAC hash of consumer key bytestring.
// Hash key is base64 - decoded LST bytestring, method is SHA1
byte[] b64_decode_lst = Convert.FromBase64String(computed_lst);

// Convert our consumer key str to bytes
byte[] consumer_bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(consumer_key);

// Hash the SHA1 bytes against our hex bytes of K.
byte[] hashed_consumer = EasySha1(b64_decode_lst, consumer_bytes);

// Convert hash to base64 to retrieve the computed live session token.
string hex_lst_hash = Convert.ToHexString(hashed_consumer).ToLower();


// If our hex hash of our computed LST matches the LST signature received in response, we are successful.
if (hex_lst_hash == lst_signature)
{
    string live_session_token = computed_lst;
    Console.WriteLine("Live session token computation and validation successful.");
    Console.WriteLine($"LST: {live_session_token}; expires: {lst_expiration}\n");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("######## LST MISMATCH! ########");
    Console.WriteLine($"Hexed LST: {hex_lst_hash} | LST Signature: {lst_signature}\n");
}
```

### Authenticated Requests With OAuth 1.0A

###### Copy Location

After successfully computing a live session token, the client would now be able to make requests. The next logical step is to make a request to /iserver/auth/ssodh/init endpoint to initialize a brokerage session as an example of standard requests.

### Initial OAuth Params

###### Copy Location

The OAuth params of standard requests are slightly different than the live session token.

**oauth\_consumer\_key:** String. Required  
A 9-character string set during your OAuth registration process.

+   Third Party OAuth: This will be provided by Interactive Brokers during the registration process.
+   First Party OAuth: This is saved in the Self Service Portal.

**oauth\_nonce:** String. Required  
A random string uniquely generated for each request.

**oauth\_timestamp:** String. Required  
Timestamp expressed in seconds since 1/1/1970 00:00:00 GMT. Must be a positive integer and greater than or equal to any timestamp used in previous requests.

**oauth\_token:** String. Required

+   Third Party OAuth: This is received from the [Access Token endpoint](#access-token)
+   First Party OAuth: This is generated in the Self Service Portal.

**oauth\_signature\_method:** String. Required  
The signature method used to sign the request. Only ‘HMAC-SHA256’ is supported.

```python
oauth_params = {
    "oauth_consumer_key": consumer_key,
    "oauth_nonce": hex(random.getrandbits(128))[2:],
    "oauth_signature_method": "HMAC-SHA256",
    "oauth_timestamp": str(int(datetime.now().timestamp())),
    "oauth_token": access_token
}
```

```
// Interactive Brokers requires a 10 digit Unix timestamp value.
// Values beyond 10 digits will result in an error.
string timestamp = DateTimeOffset.Now.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds().ToString();
timestamp = timestamp.Substring(0, timestamp.Length - 3);

// Create a Random object, and then retrieve any random positive integer value.
Random random = new();

String oauth_nonce = random.Next(1, int.MaxValue).ToString("X").ToLower();

//Create a dictionary for all oauth params in our header.
Dictionary<string, string> oauth_params = new()
{
    { "oauth_consumer_key", consumer_key },
    { "oauth_nonce", oauth_nonce },
    { "oauth_timestamp", timestamp },
    { "oauth_token", access_token },
    { "oauth_signature_method", "HMAC-SHA256" }
};
```

### Encoded Base String

###### Copy Location

The Encoded Base String for the standard requests is composed of the Method, “&”, URL, “&”, and OAuth params combined as a sorted string.

Both the URL and the parameter string **must** be URI escaped according to [Rfc3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).

```python
params_string = "&".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in sorted(oauth_params.items())])
method = 'POST'
url = f'https://{baseUrl}/oauth/live_session_token'
base_string = f"{method}&{quote_plus(url)}&{quote(params_string)}"
encoded_base_string = base_string.encode("utf-8")
```

```
// Sort our oauth_params dictionary by key.
Dictionary<string, string> sorted_params = oauth_params.OrderBy(pair => pair.Key).ToDictionary(pair => pair.Key, pair => pair.Value);

// Combine our oauth_params into a single string for our base_string.
string params_string = string.Join("&", sorted_params.Select(kv => $"{kv.Key}={kv.Value}"));

// Create a base string by combining the prepend, url, and params string.
string base_string = $"POST&{EscapeUriDataStringRfc3986(lst_url)}&{EscapeUriDataStringRfc3986(params_string)}";

// Convert our new string to a bytestring 
byte[] encoded_base_string = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(base_string);
```

### OAuth Signature

###### Copy Location

Creating the OAuth Signature is a multi-stage process.

1.  First uses will need to create an HMAC Sha256 hash of the encoded base string
    1.  You must use a Base64 byte array of our live session token as the Key value.
2.  Then, hash the encoded byte string using our new HMAC Sha256 object.
3.  Convert the resulting bytes into a Base64 encoded string.
4.  Then URI escape our string, again using [Rfc3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), to receive our final oauth\_signature value.

```python
# Generate bytestring HMAC hash of base string bytestring.
# Hash key is base64-decoded LST bytestring, method is SHA256.
bytes_hmac_hash = HMAC.new(
    key=base64.b64decode(live_session_token), 
    msg=base_string.encode("utf-8"),
    digestmod=SHA256
    ).digest()

# Generate str from base64-encoded bytestring hash.
b64_str_hmac_hash = base64.b64encode(bytes_hmac_hash).decode("utf-8")

# URL-encode the base64 hash str and add to oauth params dict.
oauth_params["oauth_signature"] = quote_plus(b64_str_hmac_hash)
```

```
// Create HMAC SHA256 object
HMACSHA256 bytes_hmac_hash_K = new()
{
    // Set the HMAC key to our live_session_token
    Key = Convert.FromBase64String(computed_lst)
};

// Hash the SHA256 bytes against our encoded bytes.
byte[] K_hash = bytes_hmac_hash_K.ComputeHash(encoded_base_string);

// Generate str from base64-encoded bytestring hash.
string b64_str_hmac_hash = Convert.ToBase64String(K_hash);

// URL-encode the base64 hash str and add to oauth params dict.
oauth_params.Add("oauth_signature", EscapeUriDataStringRfc3986(b64_str_hmac_hash));
```

### Realm

###### Copy Location

The realm is a required oauth parameter. The realm will only ever be one of two values.

If you are using the “TESTCONS” consumer key during your paper testing, you will need to use “test\_realm”

```python
# Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params["realm"] = "test_realm"
```

```
// Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params.Add("realm", :"test_realm");
```

Once you are using your own consumer key, you must use “limited\_poa”.

```python
# Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params["realm"] = "limited_poa"
```

```
// Oauth realm param omitted from signature, added to header afterward.
oauth_params.Add("realm", :"limited_poa");
```

### Authorization Header

###### Copy Location

The Authorization Header compiles our full OAuth parameters into an alphabetically-sorted string.

+   Each key/value pair must be added in the format ‘key=\\”value\\”, where each value is surrounded with quotes
+   Each pair separated with a comma.
+   The string must be prepended with “OAuth “.

The final string should be added as a header for your request using the “Authorization” header.

```python
# Assemble oauth params into auth header value as comma-separated str.
oauth_header = "OAuth " + ", ".join([f'{k}="{v}"' for k, v in sorted(oauth_params.items())])

# Create dict for LST request headers including OAuth Authorization header.
headers = {"Authorization": oauth_header}
```

```
Dictionary fin_sorted_params = oauth_params.OrderBy(pair => pair.Key).ToDictionary(pair => pair.Key, pair => pair.Value);

// Assemble oauth params into auth header value as comma-separated str.
string oauth_header = $"OAuth " + string.Join(", ", fin_sorted_params.Select(kv => $"{kv.Key}=\"{kv.Value}\""));

// Add our Authorization header to our request's header container.
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", oauth_header);
```

### Required Headers

###### Copy Location

In order to make a successful request, several headers must be included. Some libraries and modules may automatically include these values, though they must always be received by Interactive Brokers in order to successfully process request.

+   Accept: This must be set to “\*/\*”
+   Accept-Encoding: This must be set to “gzip,deflate”
+   Authorization: See our prior [Authorization Header](#standard-auth-header) step.
+   Connection: This must be set to “keep-alive”.
+   Host: This must be set to “api.ibkr.com”
+   User-Agent: This may be anything, though the browser identifier or request language is suggested.

```python
# Add User-Agent header, required for all requests. Can have any value.
headers = {
    "Authorization":oauth_header,
    "User-Agent":"python/3.11"
}
```

```
// Build out our request headers
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", oauth_header);
request.Headers.Add("Accept", "*/*");
request.Headers.Add("Accept-Encoding", "gzip,deflate");
request.Headers.Add("Connection", "keep-alive");
request.Headers.Add("Host", "api.ibkr.com");
request.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "csharp/6.0");
```

### Submit The Request

###### Copy Location

After calculating our Authorization header creating our headers, we can submit the request. As mentioned in our [Endpoints section](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/cpapi-v1/#endpoints), all content would then be submitted as JSON formatting. Examples in the respective languages have been included for our example.

```python
json_data = {"publish":True, "compete":True}

# end request to /ssodh/init, print request and response.
init_request = requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, json=json_data)
if init_request.status_code == 200:
    print(init_request.content)
```

```
string req_content = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { compete = true, publish = true });
StringContent req_content_json = new(req_content, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
request.Content = req_content_json;
HttpResponseMessage response = client.SendAsync(request).Result;
```

## Flex Web Service

###### Copy Location

The Flex Web Service is a small, standalone HTTP API for programmatically generating and retrieving pre-configured Flex Queries. Flex Queries are first constructed manually as templates in Client Portal, after which the Flex Web Service API is used to generate an instance of a report populated with up-to-date data and deliver it back to the requesting client. The Flex Web Service offers access to the same Flex Query reports that you’d otherwise retrieve manually from within Client Portal.

For more information about Flex Queries and about IB’s reporting functionality overall, please consult the following documentation:

+   [Flex Queries](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/performanceandstatements/flex.htm)
+   [Reporting Guide](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/performanceandstatements/reports.htm)

**Usage Notes:**

1.  Though Flex Query reports can be generated and retrieve at any time, the data they contain will not necessarily change throughout the day. “Activity Statement” Flex Queries contain data that is only updated once daily at close of business, so there is no benefit to generating and retrieving these reports more than once per day. Normally one would retrieve the prior day’s Activity Statements at the start of the following day, which guarantees that all values have been updated by IB’s reporting backend.
2.  “Trade Confirmation” Flex Queries will yield updated data throughout the day as executions occur against working orders, but these execution entries are also not available in Trade Confirmation Flex Queries in real-time. Typically a new execution will be available for inclusion in a newly generated Flex Query report within 5 to 10 minutes.
3.  Given the above restrictions on the refresh rate of Flex Query data, the Flex Web Service is not suitable for active polling for newly generated reports. Rather, it is best used to capture the desired reports once daily, or at most intermittently throughout the day in the case of Trade Confirmation reports.
4.  Depending on the size of the report to be generated, there may be a slight delay between the initial request to generate the report and the report’s availability via the second request. Time to availability is also dependent on system utilization, so please permit some flexibility in the timing of the final report retrieval, either via an explicit “wait” between the first and second requests, or via periodic reattempts of the second request.
5.  Note that the same Flex Query reports (as well as many other report types) can also be scheduled for delivery via email or FTP:
    +   [Scheduled Delivery of User-Defined Flex Queries](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/performanceandstatements/deliverysettingsflex.htm)
    +   [Scheduled Delivery of IB-Defined Statements](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/performanceandstatements/deliver.htm)
6.  Flex queries using a variable duration, such as “Last N Days” will always use the maximum possible days for a given request, rather than following the last used number of days in Client Portal. It is recommended to use the precise request values such as “Last Month”, “Last Quarter”, “Year To Date”, etc.

### Client Portal Configuration

###### Copy Location

Before using the Flex Web Service API to programmatically retrieve Flex Query reports, you’ll need to manually obtain some values from within **Client Portal**:

1.  An access token to authenticate our requests
2.  One or more query IDs corresponding to the reports you’d like to fetch

If you want to retrieve Flex Queries that you’ve already created, you’ll need to log into Client Portal with the username that created them, as these Flex Query report configurations are username-specific. Once we obtain these values, however, the use of the Flex Web Service API does not involve your IB credentials. Your username will only be involved in any subsequent management of the access token or reconfiguration of the report templates.

**Note:** these steps can only be completed by logging in to the Client Portal directly.

### Enable and Create Access Token

###### Copy Location

Navigate to the “Reporting” Tab, and select “Flex Queries”. Here, you can find information about your Activity Flex Query, Trade Confirmation Flex Query, Flex Query Delivery, and Flex Web Service Configuration.

We will need to start by selecting the “Flex Web Service Configuration” section on the right.

![The Flex Query page of the Client Portal.](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)

On the new page, click the empty box next to **Flex Web Service Status** to enable the Flex Web Service, and then click “Save” to save your credentials. This will enable the flex web service and provide a new “Current Token” value that will be used in your flex web service requests moving forward.

![The Configure Flex Web Service page after generating a new token.](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)

You also have the option to generate a new token. A token can be specified to remain active anywhere between 6 hours and 1 year. Generating a new token also allows users to restrict which IPs can make flex web service requests.

![The Token Generation section for the Configure Flex Web Service page.](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)

### Create a Flex Query

###### Copy Location

Returning to the Flex Queries page, we will now need to generate at least one Activity Flex Query or Trade Confirmation Flex Query.

![Highlighting the Activity Flex Query and Trade Confirmation Flex Query sections of the Flex Queries page.](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)

Next, click on the **Info** icon to the left of a Flex Query.

![Highlighting the Information button for a Flex Query.](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)

From the info pop-over, capture the **Query ID** number listed at the top. This will be used when generating your report.

![Highlight of the Query ID for a specific Flex Query.](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)

### Using Flex Web Service

###### Copy Location

The Flex Web Service API consists of two endpoints. Obtaining Flex Query reports via the Flex Web Service API is a two-step workflow involving requests to both endpoints in sequence. First, you will make a request to trigger IB’s backend to generate an instance of your report, which will populate your Flex Query template with the available data. In response, you’ll receive a reference code identifying this particular instance of the report. Next, you’ll make a request to fetch the generated report using the reference code.

Note that all requests must include a User-Agent header.

### Generate a Report

###### Copy Location

To begin, you’ll make a GET request to the `/SendRequest` endpoint, passing your access token and the desired Flex Query template’s query ID as query parameters:

`https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/AccountManagement/FlexWebService/SendRequest?t={CurrentToken}&q={QueryID}&v=3`

### Make request to /SendRequest

###### Copy Location

###### Query Params

**t**. Required  
Accepts the **Current Token** created for the Flex Web Service in Client Portal’s Account Settings interface.

**q**. Required  
The **Query ID** identifier for the desired report template, obtained from the Client Portal’s Flex Query interface.

**v**. Required, leave value = 3  
Specifies the **version** of the Flex Web Service to be used. Values `2` and `3` are supported, but version 3 should always be used.

```
requestBase = "https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/AccountManagement/FlexWebService"
token = 528191644107458877539776
queryId = 800969
flex_version = 3

send_path = "/SendRequest"
send_params = {
    "t":token, 
    "q":queryId, 
    "v":flex_version
}

flexReq = requests.get(url=requestBase+send_slug, params=send_params)
```

### Success response from /SendRequest

###### Copy Location

**Status**. A value of `Success` indicates a successful request to generate the report. If the request failed, Status will deliver `Fail`.

**ReferenceCode**. If the request was successful, the XML response will contain this numeric reference code. This code will be used in the subsequent request to retrieve the generated Flex Query.

**url**. This is a legacy URL. Should be ignored.

```
<FlexStatementResponse timestamp="28 August, 2012 10:37 AM EDT">
    <Status>Success</Status>
    <ReferenceCode>1234567890</ReferenceCode>
   <url>https://gdcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/FlexStatementService.GetStatement</url>
</FlexStatementResponse>
```

### Failure response from /SendRequest

###### Copy Location

**Status**. A failed request will deliver a Status of `Fail`.

**ErrorCode**.  
A numeric code indicating the nature of the failure. See [Error Codes](#error-codes) for a list of error code values and their descriptions.

**ErrorMessage**.  
A human-readable description of the error. See [Error Codes](#error-codes) for a list of error code values and their descriptions.

```
<FlexStatementResponse timestamp="28 August, 2012 10:37 AM EDT">
    <Status>Fail</Status>
    <ErrorCode>1012</ErrorCode>
    <ErrorMessage>Token has expired.</ErrorMessage>
</FlexStatementResponse>
```

### Retrieve the Report

###### Copy Location

Next, you’ll make a GET request to the `/GetStatement` endpoint, again passing your access token, but now passing the reference code obtained from the prior endpoint:

`https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/AccountManagement/FlexWebService/GetStatement?t={AccessToken}&q={ReferenceCode}&v=3`

Depending on the size of the request, you may need to wait longer between the /SendRequest and /GetStatement endpoint calls for the full report to finish generating.

### Make request to /GetStatement

###### Copy Location

###### Query Params

**t**. Required  
Accepts the **Access Token** created for the Flex Web Service in Client Portal’s Account Settings interface.

**q** Required  
Accepts the **ReferenceCode** returned by the previous successful request, which identifies the instance of the report to be retrieved. Note that a given Flex Query template can be used to generate multiple reports over time, each populated with data at the time of generation, so this ReferenceCode identifier is used to retrieve a specific instance, presumably the one generated immediately prior.

**v**. Required, leave value = 3  
Specifies the **version** of the Flex Web Service to be used. Values `2` and `3` are supported, but version 3 should always be used.

```
tree = ET.ElementTree(ET.fromstring(flexReq.text))
root = tree.getroot()
